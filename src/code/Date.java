     * Example 1:
     * Is 2024 a leap year and verify it using leap year calculator.
     * Solution:
     * Let us divide this year by 4 and check.
     * 2024 รท 4 = 506
     * 2024 is divisible by 4.
     * Therefore, 2024 is a leap year.
     * Example 2:
     * Is 2032 a leap year and verify it using leap year calculator.
     * Solution:
     * Let us divide this year by 4 and check.
     * 2032 รท 4 = 508
     * 2032 is divisible by 4.
     * Therefore, 2032 is a leap year.
     * Example 3:
     * Is 2032 a leap year and verify it using leap year calculator.
     * Solution:
     * Let us divide this year by 4 and check.
     * 2050 รท 4 = 1025/2
     * 2050 is not divisible by 4.
     * Therefore, 2050 is not a leap year.

     * b) for all dates in the 2000s, add 6 at the start

     * e.g. March 15 2021:
     * step 0: add 6 for dates in the 2000s: NUMBER IS 6
     * step 1: there is 1 twelve in 21; NUMBER IS 1
     * step 2: 21/12 = 1 remainder 9; NUMBER IS 9
     * step 3: there are 2 fours in 9: NUMBER IS 2
     * step 4: NUMBER IS 15
     * step 5: month code for march is 4: NUMBER IS 4
     * step 6: Add all numbers 6+1+9+2+15+4 = 37 NUMBER is 2: 37 mod 7 is 2
